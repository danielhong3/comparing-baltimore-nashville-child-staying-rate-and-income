#For Both Nashville and Baltimore I took the Lowest Quintile of each region and examined the average income, the staying rate, and the employment rate. I also investigated whether the staying rate was greater than 50%, income greater than 40k, and child employment greater than 60% and had those as filters. The primary goal of this investigation was to see whether or not income and staying rate/employment were coorelated in each region.
#Data was taken from https://www.opportunityatlas.org/

Here's one of the Nashville Graphs:
